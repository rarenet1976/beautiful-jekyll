Have you deployed Windows already for your enterpise?  Looking to centralize management and/or monitoring of devices?  Get started with joining devices to your domain using Azure AD. Azure AD is the cloud-based version of Active Directory, but less complicated. Once you have deployed Azure AD, enjoy the associated benefits of centralized management of machines and centralized sign in. 

In this tutorial, you will learn to join your device to an AD domain on a computer owned by your organization.  By doing so, you can enable your business to streamline processing and improve productivity and security, while single sign-on gives employees and business partners access to thousands of cloud applications.  As long as they have an internet connection, you can then begin to manage the windows 10 devices whereever they may be in the world.

We will start at the point where a Windows 10 device is already installed.  Ready? Lets go!

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
